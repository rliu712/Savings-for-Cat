# Rhiannon's Personal Project
My project will create a saving tracker that keeps track of the amount of money that's being saved with different categories (purposes). In this case, the categories of the savings will be *buying*:
- fish cans (5 dollar a can)
- mice toys (20 dollars each)
- cat litter (30 dollars a bag)
- and cat trees (70 dollars each).

This application is created for cat lovers (and money lovers) like me! This project interests me personally because though I'm a cat lover, I can't own any yet (due to that my family is allergic to them). So, I want to build this project to encourage and remind myself to save up money for a cat!



## User Stories

**Phase 0**
- As a user, I want to add a new saving record to my savings collection, and specify the amount of money put in, date, and its purpose (buying a bag of cat litter)
- As a user, I want to view the list of savings I've have for the purpose of buying mice toys
- As a user, I want to view how much money I still need to buy a bag of cat litter ($30)
- As a user, I want to move some of my savings from the category of buying cat litter to buying cat trees
